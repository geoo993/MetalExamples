    // commandQueue, and you would summit your work using command encoders.

        // Commands consist of things like state-setting operations (which describe how things should be drawn and what
        // resources they should be drawn with) as well as draw calls, which tell the GPU to actually draw geometry,

        // we use this descriptor to create the command encoder.
        // Metla uses descriptor to setup Metal objects.
        // descriptors are like blueprints, a descriptor allows you to set requirement and spec about your object
        // when you setup a descriptor, you are setting up the list of properties you want your object to have.
        // then you create your object from that descriptor, if you subsequently change the desciptor properties,

        // in byte code in a compressed format,

        // Once we’re done drawing, we need to call endEncoding() on our render command encoder to end the pass—and the frame:
        // Ending encoding signifies that we won’t be doing any more drawing with this render command encoder. If we wanted to draw additional objects, we would need to do that before calling endEncoding.
        commandEncoder.endEncoding()

        // In order to get our rendered content on the screen, we have to expressly present the drawable
        // whose texture we’ve be drawing into. We do this with a call on the command buffer, rather than the command encoder:
        commandBuffer.present(drawable)

        //4) send command buffer to the GPU when you finish encoding all the commands
        // Once we’re done encoding commands into the command buffer, we commit it,
        // so its queue knows that it should ship the commands over to the GPU.
